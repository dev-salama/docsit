# Start adding your docs!

DocsIt uses Markdown files to generate the documentation website. You can start adding your docs by creating a new markdown file in the folder "docs" and DocsIt will automatically generate a new page for it.

## Order your docs

You can order your docs by adding a number at the beginning of the file name. For example, "1.intro.md" will be the first page in the documentation website, "2.customize_it.md" will be the second page, and so on.

## Add hidden docs

You can add hidden docs by adding an underscore at the beginning of the file name. For example, "\_hidden.md" will not be included in the documentation website but you can link to it from other pages.

## SEO

Every markdown file has a frontmatter section at the top of the file. You can add meta tags to the frontmatter section to improve the SEO of your documentation website.

```md

title: "Intro"
description: "meta description of the page"

```
