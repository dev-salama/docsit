# Customize it

DocsIt is built on top of NuxtJs, so you can customize it the way you want. addtionally, DocsIt offers file "docsit.config.js" that you can use to customize the template without touching the code.

```js
/* 
  This is the configuration file for DocsIt.
*/

/** @type {import('.docsit/types/config').Config} */
const config = {
  title: "DocsIt",
  tagline: "Building a documentation website has never been easier!",
  favicon: "img/favicon.ico",
  logo: {
    alt: "My Site Logo",
    src: "/img/logo.png",
  },

  theme: {
    navbar: {
      title: "DocsIt",
   /*    logo: {
        alt: "My Site Logo",
        src: "/img/logo.png",
      }, */
      items: [
        {
          to: "docs/intro",
          label: "Tutorial",
        },
        {
          to: "https://github.com/devmuhnnad/docsit",
          label: "GitHub",
          newTab: true,
        },
      ],
    },

    },
  },
};

export default config;
